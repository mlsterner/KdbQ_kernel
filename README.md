# A Jupyter kernel for Kdb/q

No other dependencies beides Jupyter and Q. Easy setup. 

It is probably very rough around the edges, but seems to work. Please report any issues you end up having. 

__Other Existing Kernels__

- [IKdbQ](https://github.com/jvictorchen/IKdbQ)

# Todo

- ~~Multiline support~~ Should be done now
- Image support?
- Code cleanup
- Implementing code completion. 
- Testing (I doubt k support currently works)
- Pip/Conda publication

hello.

# Install

This requires IPython 3. Note that `q` must be in your path and `$QHOME` must be correctly defined. 

```
python -m kdbq_kernel.install
```

To make sure it is installed:

```
jupyter kernelspec list
```

To use it, run one of:

```
jupyter notebook
# In the notebook interface, select Kdb/Q from the 'New' menu
jupyter qtconsole --kernel kdbq
jupyter console --kernel kdbq
```

This kernel is heavily/entirely based on the [Bash Kernel by takluyver](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel).
